% Law of cosines: c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos(C).
% The example uses a 60-degree included angle, so cos(C) is represented as 0.5.

% Output declarations: materialize/2 selects the relations written to this example's golden output.
materialize(sideCSquared, 2).
materialize(sideC, 2).
materialize(status, 2).

% The triangle fact stores the two known sides and the cosine of the included
% angle, which avoids needing trigonometric inverse functions in the example.
% Stored tuple is triangle(Name, sideA, sideB, cosIncludedAngle).
triangle(tri60, 7, 9, 0.5).

% Compute c^2 first so both squared and square-rooted outputs can be shown.
% side_c_squared/2 follows the law of cosines step by step, then side_c/2
% takes the square root for the reported side length.
