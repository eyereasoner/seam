% Weighted path enumeration adapted from Eyeling dijkstra.n3.
% The Eyeling source uses collect/sort built-ins for Dijkstra's queue.
% This eyelang variant enumerates simple paths and keeps the bounded frontier
% that appears in the Eyeling output for a -> f.
% The input weighted graph is quoted as ... data and projected locally,
% so the route network is not asserted as ambient edge facts.

% Output declarations: materialize/2 selects the relations written to this example's golden output.
materialize(edge, 2).
materialize(path, 2).

% Program structure: facts set up the scenario, and rules derive the materialized conclusions.
weighted_graph(dijkstraGraph, (
  edge(a, arc(b, 4)),
  edge(a, arc(c, 2)),
  edge(b, arc(c, 1)),
  edge(b, arc(d, 5)),
  edge(c, arc(d, 8)),
  edge(c, arc(e, 10)),
  edge(d, arc(e, 2)),
  edge(d, arc(f, 6)),
  edge(e, arc(f, 3))
)).

% Derivation rules: each rule below contributes one logical step toward the displayed results.

  weighted_graph(dijkstraGraph, Context),
  holds(Context, edge(A, arc(B, Cost))).

  link(Node, Next, StepCost),
  not_member(Next, Visited),
  path(Next, Goal, [Next|Visited], Path, RestCost),
