% Run:
%   eyelang socket-family.pl

% Output declarations: materialize/2 selects the relations written to this example's golden output.
materialize(ancestor, 2).

% Program structure: facts set up the scenario, and rules derive the materialized conclusions.
socket(family_source, provides(parent_2)).
plug(family_file, family_source).

parent(pat, jan).
parent(jan, emma).

% Derivation rules: each rule below contributes one logical step toward the displayed results.
